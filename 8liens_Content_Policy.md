Content Policy for 8liens forums and chat rooms
========================
_(collectively referred to as the **8liens properties**)_

### 1. Stay on Topic
The 8liens properties are a place to discuss matters related to the [8liens](https://8liens.xyz/). Discussions that are off-topic to this will be closed and potentially deleted. Comments within a discussion may naturally veer in different directions, and this is generally not a problem. However, if the moderators feel that the comment chain has reached its limit, we will give a polite notice about being off topic before moderation is used.

### 2. No Self-Promotion
"Self-promotion" is an attempt to redirect traffic from the 8liens properties to your personal blog, chat, YouTube channel, etc. Pure self-promotion will not be allowed, however, if you are trying to get feedback and reviews from the community for your 8liens-based project, or an outlet of your original content that relates to 8liens in some direct manner, then reasonable and limited promotion is permitted. If you are unsure, please ask a mod before doing so.

### 3. Choose Your Curse Words Wisely
Comments that contain profanity may be held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inflame will always be removed.

### 4. Don't Be a Jerk
Personal attacks, insults with hostile intent, stalking, harassment, slander, and using offensive speech will not be tolerated. Discussions and comments with the sole purpose of antagonizing or provoking (i.e. trolling) will be removed, and your account may be banned. Sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed.

### 5. No Scams
Promoting manipulative schemes that directly seek to enrich one group (normally the founders) at the expense of another group (normally those that come later and are not “insiders”) are not tolerated. If your posting is deemed by the moderators (at their sole opinion) to be a scam, it will be deleted and your account may be banned.

### 6. No Copying and Pasting
Do not copy and paste someone else's writing without due credit or notice. Please provide a link to your sources.

### 7. No Spam
Spam is the posting of unsolicited messages, generally advertising a product or service. Spam can also be the repeated posting of the same message multiple times. Either form of "spamming" is strictly prohibited. Please note that accounts that post advertising spam will be banned without warning.

### 8. English Only, Unless Stated Otherwise
Discussions and comments posted in languages other than English will be removed. This does not apply to “Local” forums or local channels that feature a specific language, such as Chinese. This also does not apply if you are using another language to make a point or using it colloquially rather than as primary communication.

### 9. No Sexual Content
As the old saying goes, “we know it when we see it.”
